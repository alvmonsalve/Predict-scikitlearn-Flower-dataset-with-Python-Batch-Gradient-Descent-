# Predict scikitlearn Flower dataset with Python Batch Gradient Descent

Description: a multinomial Logistic Regression for the Iris dataset is implemented first using the scikitlearn library and then I create an algorithm to find the classes based on a batch gradient descent equations.

Input: Iris dataset. A public available set of 150 flowers with details of the their Petal Length and Width

Output: Multiclass Prediction Classifier Version: Python 3.6.9
